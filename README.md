[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/compiler-dept/speck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/compiler-dept/speck)

`Speck`, pronounced as /ˈbeɪ.kən/.

`Speck` is a small and fast unit testing framework for the C programming
language, that helps you to keep track of your programs integrity throughout
your development. It is provided as a set of just two source files that are
copied into your project. There is also no need for extra scripts that
generate your test code from a specification. Your specification is the test
itself and it too is written in pure C.

## Quick Start

To get started using `Speck` for your tests, you just have to copy the files
`speck.c` and `speck.h` into the root folder of your C project. Create a folder
called `spec` that will hold your test suites:

    $ mkdir spec

You will need to add some rules to your `Makefile` in order to compile `speck`
and your tests.

The first rule you need to add, is the list of test suites:

    SUITES=$(patsubst %.c, %.so, $(wildcard spec/*.c))

This wildcard matches all `.c` files in your `spec` folder as
a single test suite.

Every `Speck` test suite is compiled into a shared object file (`.so`) and then
loaded and executed by `Speck`. Every piece of code that needs to be tested
has to be compiled additionally into the test suites. For this to work you need to add
another rule to your `Makefile`:

    spec/%.so: spec/%.c
        @$(CC) -fPIC -shared -o $@ $<

At the end of the second line you can attach further files (`.c`, `.o`, `.s`) or
libraries (`-lx`) to pull in all code needed for execution. You can also use all
kinds of `CFLAGS` and other options you need to compile the test suites.

Of course we need a rule to compile `Speck` itself:

    speck: speck.c
    	$(CC) -std=c11 -o $@ $< -ldl

Don't worry, we're almost done. However, wouldn't it be nice to be able to call your tests with
`make test`? Therefore we need a last rule:

    test: speck $(SUITES)
    	@./speck

The rule tells `make`, that if the target `test` is executed, `Speck` and all
test suites have to be compiled and then executes `Speck`.

For your convenience, all the `Makefile` additions in one place:

    SUITES=$(patsubst %.c, %.so, $(wildcard spec/*.c))

    spec/%.so: spec/%.c
	    @$(CC) -g -fPIC -shared -o $@ $<

    speck: speck.c
   	    $(CC) -g -std=c11 -o $@ $< -ldl

    test: speck $(SUITES)
       	@./speck

## Writing Tests

To start writing tests, you have to know, that you can organize your tests in
test suites. Every suite is represented as a `.c` file in the `spec` directory.

Let's create a first test suite to test some arithmetics:

    $ touch spec/arithmetics.c

The first thing you need to do is insert the `include` to the
header file `speck.h` into the suite.

    #include "../speck.h"

Because the test suites are plain C, you can include any header you want, to
build your tests.

`Speck` searches for specific test functions that are to be executed later. They must
match the following form:

    void spec_<name>(void)
    {
        // test code
    }

The only thing you may change is the `<name>` tag of the function. `Speck` will
run all functions defined this way. Let's write a first test for our suite:

    void spec_addition(void)
    {
        int number = 4 + 3;

        sp_assert_equal_i(number, 7);
    }

As you can see, we wrote some code we want to test (`int number = 4 + 3;`). We
assume we are testing the `+` operator for its correctness. To give `Speck` a
way of determining if everything worked out as expected , you have to use assertions. There
are different types of assertions implemented. Scroll down to find out what
assertions are possible. In the **addition** example above, we let `Speck` check
that `number` is indeed `7` at the end of the test.

## Assertions

There are currently the following assertions implemented:

- `sp_assert(expression)`: Evaluate the expression and fail if the result is
false.
- `sp_assert_equal_i(number_a, number_b)`: Evaluate the equality of both numbers
and fail if they're different.
- `sp_assert_equal_d(double_a, double_b, epsilon`: Pass if double_a and double_b are within epsilon of each other.

## Running Speck

If you have finished writing your test suites, you can run `Speck`:

    $ make test
